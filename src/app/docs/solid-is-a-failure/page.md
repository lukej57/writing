    title: SOLID is a Failure
    description: OOP lacks intellectual foundations and FP is the path to higher understanding.
---

 - SOLID articulates good properties, but:
 - - Fails to emphasises dependency inversion
 - - Has no "most important thing" or "fundamental fact" that it rests on
 - - Is unintuitive and convoluted compared to the foundations of FP.

Intellectual growth as a developer, in my experience, has come exclusively from understanding functional principles.
Functional programming is a genuinely principled paradigm with mathematical foundations.
OOP patterns tend to be a partial, ad hoc rediscoveries of functional principles.
OOP wisdom tends to be purely practical "I did X and Y happened."
OOP is just imperative programming organised into classes, it's not even a true paradigm the way FP is.

Functional Core, Imperative Shell is far more useful to a developer than SOLID.
It's not that SOLID is wrong, but it simply does not enlighten the way FCIS does.
